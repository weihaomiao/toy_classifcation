Toy Classification using Machine Learning -- MITx 6.86x coursework

In this repository, I will demonstrate my understanding of perceptron algorithm、average perceptron algorithm, and pegasos algorthm by finding each algorithm optinal theta and theta_0

Theory:
  perceptron algorihtm for classification:
  




Workflow:
  explore data
  finding best theta and theta_0
  plot graph
  test results
